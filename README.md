1. I thought of choosing python language as I have made few micro-service app.

2. Couldn't implement docker or test cases.

3. I can set the roles via getting the input from the user during signup.

4. I will make all the api's authenticated with the type of users needed using jwt .

5.  Used postgresql , connected through sqlalchemy.
